PFIX

Perl FIX protocol implementation.

The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) Protocol is a messaging standard developed specifically for the real-time electronic exchange of securities transactions. FIX is a public-domain specification owned and maintained by FIX Protocol, Ltd.

This module offers some simple methods to parse or build a FIX message.
It has knowledge of the FIX dictionary.

The module here is vastly imcomplete but was written for an interface project (now in production) and thus is operational.
However to take it to the next step it needs more work.

Although I will do my best to minimise radical changes, next versions may not be backward compatible - be prepared (sorry).
